# Advanced Dungeon and Dragons Character Generator

## Description

- A RESTful API application to generate, save, and update player character sheets for the roleplaying game AD&D

- We are building this project to ease the management of character storage and updating of statistics and to share our passion for role playing games

- Characters can be auto generated or stats can be entered manually

- Registered users will be able to access saved character sheets, edit, and delete them

- This app will replace maintaining characters on paper

## Operation
- Users will access the app at a [heroku url](https://warm-castle-28524.herokuapp.com/)
- Users will have to login to access stored characters
- Users will have a great time imagining what adventures await their newly created characters
